# Open Source SendMail Service for GemStone/S 64 Bit

The Send Mail Service for GemStone/S features:

* [Verifying Email Addresses](#verifying-email-addresses).
* [Sending Mail](#sending-mail).

##Introduction
The SendMail Service for GemStone uses the ServiceVM interface to send email directly to the recipient's mail server rather than via an intermediary mail server.

Clone the [SendMailService project][2] to your GemStone development server and create a unique branch to keep any changes you make for your project isolated from the SendMailService master branch:

   ```Shell
   git clone https://github.com/TerraAustralis/SendMailService.git
   cd SendMailService
   git checkout -b  <your project branch name>
   ```
